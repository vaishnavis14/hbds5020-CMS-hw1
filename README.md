This lab assignment involves an exploratory data analysis of the 2008 Beneficiary Summary file from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) DE-SynPUF dataset. The dataset provides synthetic records of Medicare beneficiaries, allowing for research while preserving privacy. Key tasks include summarizing general characteristics such as the number of unique beneficiaries, states, and counties, as well as demographic details like age distribution and mortality. The analysis also investigates the prevalence of depression by sex, compares chronic condition counts by age group, and explores the relationship between chronic conditions and total Medicare spending.
